		<h3> Client Testimonials </h3>
		<aside>*Please note that all of these have to be anonymous.</aside>

		<p>"Thank you for the excellent job you did earlier this week. Nobody ever wants to spend money on these types of matters but the case did ultimately cost us less money than we would have expended in a trial."
		</p>
		<p>"Thanks Chris.  You did a great job bringing this one to a settlement.  My clients are very grateful, and as always, I appreciate your skill, intellect, and humor."
		</p>
		<p>"Thanks to you for never giving up and helping both sides make a good decision very early in the process!"
