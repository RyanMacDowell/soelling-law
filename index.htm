		<blockquote>"Litigation is a poor way to make money, and the construction companies 
	hurt their relations with clients when they are constantly suing people."  
		<footer class="tab">-Barbara Ashley Phillips, <cite>The Mediation Field Guide</cite></footer></blockquote>

		<p>The above advice is not limited to the construction industry.  Few make 
		money in litigation, especially when you factor in lost opportunity costs and distraction 
		from one's core business.  Parties embroiled in a dispute 
		increasingly use mediation as their preferred tool for dispute resolution 
		because it's quick, inexpensive, and lets them maintain control.</p>

		<p>Lawyers looking for a neutral committed to settling even the most complicated disputes have trusted Chris 
		Soelling for the last 27 years.  Prior to his work as a full-time neutral, Chris practiced as a commercial 
		trial lawyer in Seattle.  He has mediated 
		and arbitrated thousands of cases in the commercial arena, including 
		construction, real estate, insurance coverage, and business disputes of all 
		kinds.  Chris is especially recognized for resolving challenging cases involving 
		multiple parties.  He is candid, even-handed, and tenacious-qualities that 
		have made him one of the most requested mediators in the Pacific Northwest.
