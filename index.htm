		<blockquote>Litigation is a poor way to make money, and the construction companies 
	hurt their relations with clients when they are constantly suing people.  
		<footer>-Barbara Ashley Phillips in <cite>The Mediation Field Guide</cite></footer></blockquote>

		<p>The above advice is not limited to the construction industry.  Few make 
		money in litigation, especially when lost opportunity costs and distraction 
		from one's core business are factored in.  Parties embroiled in a dispute 
		increasingly use mediation as their preferred tool for dispute resolution 
		because it's quick, inexpensive, and lets them maintain control.</p>

		<p>Lawyers looking for a neutral who will get the job done have called on Chris 
		Soelling for the last 12 years.  He practiced 20 + years as a commercial 
		trial lawyer in Seattle before becoming a full-time neutral. He has mediated 
		and arbitrated hundreds of cases in the commercial arena, including 
		construction, real estate, insurance coverage, and business disputes of all 
		kinds.  He is especially well known for resolving complex cases involving 
		multiple parties.  He is candid, even-handed and tenacious, qualities that 
		have made him one of the most requested mediators in the Pacific Northwest.
